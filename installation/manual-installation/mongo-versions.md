# Supported Mongo Versions

Rocket.Chat currently requires MongoDB from version 3.2 and higher. We recommend using version 3.6.9.

**Note**   
 Without mongodb version we can't ensure you are running a compatible version. If you are running your mongodb with auth enabled and an **user different from admin** you may need to grant permissions for this user to check cluster data.   
 You can do it via mongo shell running the following command replacing the string _YOUR\_USER_ by the correct user\'s name:

```text
db.runCommand({ grantRolesToUser: "YOUR_USER" , roles: [{role: "clusterMonitor", db: "admin"}]})
```

## Supported Storage Engines

The Storage engine recommended for Rocket.Chat is [MMAPv1](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/mmapv1/).

We are currently testing [WiredTiger](http://www.wiredtiger.com/) for better performance with larger servers, but for now you should stick to MMAPv1 for large installs.
